# dbt_twitter v0.10.0

[PR #32](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/32) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Change for dbt Core < 1.9.6
> *Note: This is not relevant to Fivetran Quickstart users.*

Migrated `freshness` from a top-level source property to a source `config` in alignment with [recent updates](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/11506) from dbt Core ([Source PR #31](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter_source/pull/31)). This will resolve the following deprecation warning that users running dbt >= 1.9.6 may have received:

```
[WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
Found `freshness` as a top-level property of `twitter_ads` in file
`models/src_twitter_ads.yml`. The `freshness` top-level property should be moved
into the `config` of `twitter_ads`.
```

**IMPORTANT:** Users running dbt Core < 1.9.6 will not be able to utilize freshness tests in this release or any subsequent releases, as older versions of dbt will not recognize freshness as a source `config` and therefore not run the tests.

If you are using dbt Core < 1.9.6 and want to continue running Twitter Ads freshness tests, please elect **one** of the following options:
  1. (Recommended) Upgrade to dbt Core >= 1.9.6
  2. Do not upgrade your installed version of the `twitter_ads` package. Pin your dependency on v0.9.0 in your `packages.yml` file.
  3. Utilize a dbt [override](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/overrides) to overwrite the package's `twitter_ads` source and apply freshness via the [old](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter_source/blob/v0.9.0/models/src_twitter_ads.yml#L10-L12) top-level property route. This will require you to copy and paste the entirety of the `src_twitter_ads.yml` [file](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter_source/blob/v0.9.0/models/src_twitter_ads.yml#L4-L710) and add an `overrides: twitter_ads_source` property.

## Under the Hood
- Updated the package maintainer PR template.

## Feature Updates
- Added the `twitter_ads__using_campaign_locations_report` and `twitter_ads__using_campaign_regions_report` variables, which can be used to enable or disable the above transformations related to the `campaign_locations_report` and `campaign_regions_report` tables. ([#31](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/31))
  - These variables are dynamically set for Fivetran Quickstart users, but **false** by default otherwise. See [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter?tab=readme-ov-file#country-and-region-reports) for more details.
- Introduced the `twitter_ads__campaign_locations_report_passthrough_metrics` and `twitter_ads__campaign_regions_report_passthrough_metrics` passthrough column variables, which can be used to pass through additional metrics fields from their respective source reports to downstream models (`twitter_ads__campaign_country_report` and `twitter_ads__campaign_region_report`, respectively). See [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter?tab=readme-ov-file#passing-through-additional-metrics) for more details. ([#31](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/31))

## Documentation
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#30](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/30))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#30](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/30))
- Fixed broken links to dbt model documentation in the README. ([#29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/29))
- Applied minor formatting improvements to the README. ([#29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/29))
- Updated LICENSE. ([#31](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/31))

## Under the Hood
- Added data validation tests for the new country and region report end models. ([#31](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/31))

# dbt_twitter v0.8.0

[PR #26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/26) includes the following **BREAKING CHANGE** updates:

## Feature Updates: Native Conversion Support
We have added more robust support for conversions in our data models by doing the following:
- Created the `twitter_ads__conversion_fields` and `twitter_ads__conversion_sale_amount_fields` variables to pass through conversion metrics (total number and monetary value, respectively). Conversion metrics are split into these 2 variables due to the N:1 relationship between Twitter conversions and their conversion value fields.
  - By default, `twitter_ads__conversion_fields` will include `conversion_purchases_metric` and `conversion_custom_metric`.
  - By default, `twitter_ads__conversion_sale_amount_fields` will include `conversion_purchases_sale_amount` and `conversion_custom_sale_amount`.
  - These conversion fields will be included in each end model report. Additionally, they will be summed up into new `total_conversions` and `total_conversions_sale_amount` columns.
  - See [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter?tab=readme-ov-file#customizing-types-of-conversions) for more details on how to configure these variables.

## Under the Hood
- Ensured the above changes maintain backwards compatibility with [existing passthrough column variables](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter?tab=readme-ov-file#passing-through-additional-metrics). 
  - Added a new [version](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter_ads/blob/main/macros/twitter_ads_persist_pass_through_columns.sql) of the `persist_pass_through_columns()` [macro](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/blob/v0.4.10/macros/persist_pass_through_columns.sql) in which we can include coalesces and properly check between conversion field values and the existing passthrough columns.
- Added integrity and consistency validation tests within `integration_tests` for the Twitter Ads transformation models.

## Documentation
- Highlighted all metrics included in the package by default. Previously, `url_clicks` and `spend_micro` were missing from this README [section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter?tab=readme-ov-file#passing-through-additional-metrics).
- Documented how to configure the new `twitter_ads__conversion_fields` and `twitter_ads__conversion_sale_amount_fields` variables [here](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter?tab=readme-ov-file#customizing-types-of-conversions).
- Added Contributors [subsection](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors) to README.

# dbt_twitter v0.7.0
[PR #21](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/21) includes the following updates:
## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple twitter connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro.

  - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.

[PR #18](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter/pull/18) includes the following updates:
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.

  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
